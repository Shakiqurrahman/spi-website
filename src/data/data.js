        desc : `International Mother Language Day is observed annually on February 21st. It is a worldwide observance to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and to raise awareness about the importance of preserving and promoting mother languages.

        The day was first proclaimed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1999 to honor the Bengali Language Movement in Bangladesh, which took place on February 21, 1952. On that day, students and activists protested against the imposition of Urdu as the official language in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), resulting in several casualties. The movement ultimately led to the recognition of Bangla (Bengali) as one of the official languages of Pakistan and, later, the independence of Bangladesh.
        
        The significance of International Mother Language Day lies in acknowledging the role of mother languages in preserving cultural heritage and promoting the values and traditions of different communities. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of linguistic diversity and the need to protect endangered languages, as many languages are at risk of disappearing due to globalization and other factors.
        
        On this day, various events, workshops, and seminars are held around the world to celebrate linguistic diversity, promote multilingual education, and create awareness about the importance of mother languages. Schools, universities, cultural organizations, and governments often organize activities to highlight the value of mother languages in promoting mutual understanding, tolerance, and sustainable development.`
